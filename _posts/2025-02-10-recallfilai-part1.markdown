When the api receives a request to add a file.

2. stores it in s3.
3. sends an async request to the malware detection service.
4. listens to the response and acts accordingly.
    * if malware detected, deletes the file from s3 add it's hash to a blacklist.
    * keep the metadata of the content with the malware status set to **MALWARE_DETECTED**.
